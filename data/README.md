# SPAVE-28G
The Geo-Positioning-System (GPS), Inertial-Motion-Unit (IMU), and Power-Delay-Profile (PDP) samples associated with this signal propagation modeling activity on the NSF POWDER testbed are too large to be archived here. Hence, researchers needing these collected measurement samples should send an email to <bkeshav1@asu.edu> or <bkeshava@purdue.edu> for instructions on accessing them on our compute clusters via a custom REST/SOAP API.

A smaller version of our full POWDER V2X 28GHz dataset is available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7178597 .
